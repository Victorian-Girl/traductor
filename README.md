# traductor
simple traductor

Another small programme i have made in my first year of programming.

SÃ¬mple traductor. Small one you can put anywhere in your screen when you need it!

- You can add more language in it.
- Just add it to the line <choices>
- Also, you can change the ""open choices"" language at the line <lan1.set> and <lan2.set>
